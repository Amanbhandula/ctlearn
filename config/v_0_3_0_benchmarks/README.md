# CTLearn v0.3.0 Benchmarks

These configuration files can be used to show CTLearn's operation for training both single telescope and array models using simulations from all CTA telescopes. They reflect simple, minimally optimized models to be trained on a small dataset and so are meaningful only for demonstration and validation purposes and may not accurately reflect the performance of the various CTA telescopes.

To use these config files on your machine, change the following file paths as needed: Logging:model_directory, Data:file_list, Model:model_directory, Prediction:prediction_file_path, Multiple Configurations Settings:run_combinations_path, all paths to data files in prototype_files_class_balanced.txt (note that lines below 62 in that file are commented out).
